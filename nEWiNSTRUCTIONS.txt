Given:
o The starter recipe webapp you wrote (see above) 
o Some USDA macros data: https://faculty-web.msoe.edu/yoder/macro.csv
 
Goal: Estimate the nutritional quantity of the macronutrients in whatever recipe is selected/input from the UI.

first thoughts: avoid leading and trailing spaces, remove unwanted matches, case insensitive also quotation marks, 
	doubles for the decimals looks like last three items in each record, maybe use regex to only get characters or numbers including decimals,
	do i need to ask about deduping

	Define standards of nutritional values per serving size - standard american diet 2k calories or what to influence the serving size calculation?
		- maybe have a default serving size but allow user to adjust it
		- maybe have a default number of servings but allow user to adjust it

token ranked matching : vEGGIE oMELETE
ingredient lists of my user entered receipes may match entire recipes or may match ingredients

//does entire recipe match
if (Title.Contains(description))
if (Ingredients.Foreach(x => x.Contains(description))
if ()
