Given:
o The starter recipe webapp you wrote (see above) 
o Some USDA macros data: https://faculty-web.msoe.edu/yoder/macro.csv
 
Goal: Estimate the nutritional quantity of the macronutrients in whatever recipe is selected/input from the UI.

first thoughts: avoid leading and trailing spaces, remove unwanted matches, case insensitive also quotation marks, 
	doubles for the decimals looks like last three items in each record, maybe use regex to only get characters or numbers including decimals,
	do i need to ask about deduping

	Define standards of nutritional values per serving size - standard american diet 2k calories or what to influence the serving size calculation?
		- maybe have a default serving size but allow user to adjust it
		- maybe have a default number of servings but allow user to adjust it

token ranked matching : vEGGIE oMELETE
ingredient lists of my user entered receipes may match entire recipes or may match ingredients

//does entire recipe match
if (Title.Contains(description))
if (Ingredients.Foreach(x => x.Contains(description))
if ()

Second converstaion with Grok - https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_0b542245-8bd2-43fc-9ef1-56cc7278a846

Implement embeddings with Grok:

	First prompted Grok to help me understand embeddings:
		Explain how I could use embeddings, semantic or synaptic with pattern matching in this dataset? 
			Here is a sample of the dataset I provided:	
				fdc_id,description,calories,proteinInGrams,carbohydratesInGrams,fatInGrams
				1104647,"Garlic, raw",144.3302574431088,6.56235551079862,29.277508528918112,0.4066051488621757
				1104705,"Flour, soy, defatted",366.0,51.1,32.9,3.33
				1104766,"Flour, soy, full-fat",452.0,38.6,27.9,20.7


	Added new dataset and all project files to Grok and used the following prompts:
		Okay show me how to incorporate this into my project now, first if I were to use an AI service, actually help me do this with you first. 
		I have attached both data files to this project now and all the code in the project. 
		I want to create a nutritional profile for my recipes using the macro.csv dataset, which you will need to help me parse into memory or maybe not, 
		how can I set up an endpoint with you Grok to send the data file in and u can give me back embeddings to properly rank my ingredient or recipe matches?
